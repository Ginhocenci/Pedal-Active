WORK IN INPROGRESS NOT A FINAL DESIGN
# DIY-Sim-Racing-Active-Pedal
This is my DIY Simucube Active Pedal prototype, an affordable alternative to the official Simucube active pedals that cost over $2,000 per pedal. The pedal uses a load cell to measure the force applied to the pedal, a NEMA 23 Integrated Easy Servo Motor to drive the lead screw, and an Arduino Pro Micro to control everything. I used Fusion 360 to create CAD models for all the 3d printed parts. While there are still some issues to address, such as shaky ADC readings and a lack of computing power on the Arduino, I'm proud of what I've achieved so far and hope to inspire others to take on similar DIY projects. Check out the video of the pedal in action, and feel free to contribute to the project or share your own DIY ideas!

**Current Build of Materials ~$250** Some of these parts will be switched out as I only picked them cause I had them laying around
- 300kg Load Cell $36.69 (changing out for a 100Kg load cell)
- NEMA 23 Integrated Easy Servo Motor 130w ( iSV57T-130 ) $93.93 (Could probably get away with the smaller 90 watt version and cut down on the overall length of the pedal)
- ADS1256 $17.99
- 8x 608-2RS Ball Bearing $8.99
- Tr8x8 Lead Screw with T8 Brass Nut $11.99 (upgrading to a 1605 150mm ball screw in the future)
- 8mm to 8mm Shaft Coupling $9.99 (will need to change to a 12mm to 8mm coupling to work with ball screw)
- Arduino Pro Micro $8.00
- 2x Micro Limit Switch $5.99
- DROK 48V Power Supply, AC 110V/220V to DC 0-48V 10A 480W $40.99 (Can be changed to a 24V 200W power supply)
- L7805CV Voltage Regulator $0.32

**To Do List**
- Solder all wire connects to hopefully get more consistant readings on the ADS1256 & switch to a 100kg Load Cell
- Create a wiring diagram
- Update mechanical design to be more robust and use new components like the 1605 150mm Ball Screw & 100kg Load Cell
- Create a Build of Materials with links
